December 2016 issue of Maximum Rocknroll, #403 — the **all-China issue!** We’ve got a **Chinese punk history primer**, scene reports from **Bejing**, **Wuhan**, and **Guangdong**, an annotated discography of Chinese punk, and reprints of MRR features on Chinese punk straight from our archive. We have interviews with experimental indie band **SUBS**, noise punkers **DIDERS**, and heavy metal influenced street punks **DEMERIT**. We’ve also got photo spreads from Toronto’s **Not Dead Yet Fest**, along with the Slovakian crust band **BETON**’s photo tour diary of Brazil. Plus, a guest column by Arina Moiseyenko as well as all of our regular columns and reviews. Don’t miss out!\\
