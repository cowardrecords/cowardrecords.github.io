This one features Croatian bands including the wild synth-punk of **KAOS**, Rijeka’s **PARAF** as well as **KUD IDIJOTI** and **BESPOSLIČARI** from the small yet bustling scene of Pula, plus some classic Slovenian groups such as **BULDOŽER**, **LUBLANSKI PSI**, and Ljubljana’s **NIET**. We also got a chance to get in some of the latest and greatest in North American hardcore, interviewing the globetrotting Bay Area straightedge outfit [TØRSÖ](https://torsoxvx.bandcamp.com/){:target="_blank"} and Toronto teenage maniacs [MOLLOT](https://mollot.bandcamp.com/){:target="_blank"}. The UK’s [DOMESTICS](https://www.facebook.com/TheDomestics){:target="_blank"} talk about their unrelenting dedication to punk in East Anglia, and [RED RED KROVVY](https://soundcloud.com/red-red-krovvy){:target="_blank"} also sit down for their first MRR interview ten years after their formation as a high school punk band on Australia’s isolated north coast. Also featured: an article on **Mabel Valdiviezo**, whose upcoming documentary [Prodigal Daughter](http://www.maximumrocknroll.com/mrr-398/www.prodigaldaughterthemovie.com/){:target="_blank"} tells her story as a punk woman in the DIY subterráneo scene in Lima in the ‘80s, coming to the US as an undocumented immigrant in the ‘90s, and her subsequent return home. This issue also includes an **Iowa City scene report**, a photo spread from **Nothing Nice To Say fest**, hundreds of reviews (records, demos, books, films; you name it), another fix of your favorite columnists; in short, another high stakes, buy-or-die edition of MRR.\\
