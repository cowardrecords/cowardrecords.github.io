*I can change or stay the same  
and everytime i try to start again  
Cause it's never too late to be whoever you want to be  
it's never too late to be a dancing star.  
I saw the world around me  
and i'm not the same any more  
When you stop and look around  
Have no fear  
Please stop and look around  
We can change  
Or stay the same  
We are all  
Stars.*
