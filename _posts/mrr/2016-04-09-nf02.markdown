Issue #2 has interviews with Australia’s uncertain rock’n’roll saviors ROYAL HEADACHE, Bay-Area sociopolitical comedian, former host of Totally Biased and current host of The United Shades of America, W. Kamau Bell, Chicago’s own post-punk/goth darlings STARING PROBLEM, Spain’s infectious, melodic, broody punks JUANITA Y LOS FEOS, Germany’s gruff-n-melodic HELL AND BACK, founding member of the CURE and member through the Disintegration album, LOL TOLHURST, Milwaukee emotional punks, and local scene workhorses Marcy, Macedonia’s favorite post-punk/dance anarchists BERNAY’S PROPAGANDA, Bay-Area based sex worker legal aid resource RED LIGHT LEGAL, and St. Louis’ angular and driven punks TRAUMA HARNESS. We also have a report on the "northern isolation" fest in Minnesota from earlier in the year, and a great tour journal from Chicago, BOILERMAN - not to mention a sea of columns, photographs, and the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of reviews of all the music, zines, and books we’ve received in the past few months. 

This 2nd issue with a 7” split flexi. All 4 bands have direct connections to Chicago. The record features music by the ethereal post-punks SIAMESE TWINS, brain damaged synth punks PLASTIC, the raging hardcore of basement dwellers MACE, and the beer-soaked garage hardcore of UFUX.
