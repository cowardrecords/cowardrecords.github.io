It’s the moment you’ve been waiting for: the latest issue of Maximum Rocknroll is here! MRR #419, our April 2018 issue, brings you old-school style with an all cut ‘n’ paste layout. Inside, we bring you the scoop on all your new (and old!) favorite punks: Spain’s RATA NEGRA refuse to just go for the easy joke, while Florida’s PROTOCOL insist you can’t be serious all the time. Who’s right? They both are, of course! We teach you some history lessons with a rundown of rare Finnish KBD punk and an interview with Wyoming’s COWS—if punk made it to small-town Finland and Wyoming in the ’70s, then punk can make it anywhere. That includes rural Italy, where DOTS are getting people dancing to their funky punk as we speak, and Sweden, where KATASTROF do their part to keep the Uppsala hardcore scene strong.

Punk can last, too: just ask Portland’s WOOLEN MEN, who discuss wanting to make a record that stands the test of time. Or Michigan’s CLOUD RAT, who analyze how their genre-overlapping sound has changed over the past eight years. Or Japan’s ILLYA, who have lasted eleven years in spite of never getting to go on long tours. Or LEMURIA, who might live all over the US now, but are still going strong after fourteen years. Hell, the FORCED ORDER guys have been playing together since high school, and now they’re pushing 30! SCORE‘s members have persevered through chronic illness and immigration difficulties to keep playing, But if life gets in the way, you can always come back to punk later, like the mysterious man behind Neck Chop Records did. And if that’s not enough for you, we’ve got all the reviews and columns you crave, plus more, all right here in the latest, greatest issue of Maximum Rocknroll!\\
