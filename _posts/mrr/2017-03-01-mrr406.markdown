Philadelphia hardcore band **S-21** tell us the history behind their name, **BETON** give us their take on a Brazil tour, **ZERODENT** get us dancing in Perth, **PELUQUERÍA CANINA** play melodic punk in Madrid, **SECOND COMBAT** keep straightedge hardcore alive in Malaysia, PALBERTA gets weird in New York, Brazil’s **VIDA RUIM** spread their love for HÜSKER DÜ, and Austin’s **BODY PRESSURE** want to “Make Bigots Scared Again.” We have an update on our **Archive Project** progress and then we delve into some lesser known Finnish KBD gems from the new compilation **Kuoleman Tappaneet**, talk with punk writer and zinester **Jessie Lynn McMains**, plus the debut of two new columns on DIY Metal and European punk life. We’ve also got photos from **Chicago’s Infestational** and **This Is Austin Not That Great**. All this plus the record, demo, book, zine, and films reviews you love. Order today!\\
