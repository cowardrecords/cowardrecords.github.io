the January 2017 issue is here! In light of the impending Trump presidency, we have a very useful guide to basic **cybersecurity**, revolutionary **reading lists**, Q&A’s from **Transgress Fest**, and more. We have photo spreads from **Static Shock Fest** and the current **Mexico City punk scene**, plus interviews with Copenhagen/worldwide queer art punks **PRISON**, Kansas City freaks **PHANTOM HEAD**, and everyone’s favorite Berlin-based phenomenon **DIÄT**. Dublin post-punkers the **BLOW INS** talk about carving out space for Polish punks in a new country, Baltimore’s **QUITTER** share the trials and tribulations of gas station food and sweaty jumpsuits, and Oakland’s **HARD LEFT** can’t decide if they are hard mod or utopian Oi! (maybe Turbo can help?). It all wraps up with Canadian raw punk band **PARASYTES**, a joint interview with **LAKES** and **TOL** (two Australian bands that share members), and Scottish vegan straightedge riot grrrls **BRATAKUS**. Get it today!\\
