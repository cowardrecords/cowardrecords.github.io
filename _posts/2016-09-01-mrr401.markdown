Here it is, Maximum Rocknroll #401, October 2016. This special edition is our **ART ISSUE**—how much can you take? We’ve got an interview with **Olivia Gibb**, who came all the way out from Kansas City as our very first MRR artist-in-residence to design this issue’s cover, and conversations between Tokyo photographer **Chiro Yoshikawa** and Los Angeles artist/designer **Sonya Sombreuil** (of Come Tees renown) as well as between Toronto’s **Lia Lepre** and **Sebbe Melbourne**. Plus: interviews with Los Angeles-based artist **Jess Scott**, New Orleanian comics artist **Ben Passmore**, and Indiana’s **Alex Micallef**; a convo between **Osa Atoe** and video artist **Perry Holstein**; and a feature on the **“This Record Changed My Life”** exhibition at Copenhagen’s K-Town Hardcore Fest. Other artists represented in this issue include **Sarah Sequoia, Ashley Hohman, Apolo Cacho, Sam Wallman, Shitboy Face, Trevor 32, Mónica Di Francesco, Luke Kislak, Aaron Demuth, Cecilia Calidera, Joseph Heuermann, Keith Caves, Josh Feigert**, and **Rael Brian Rau**. On top of all that, we’ve got a photo spread from a gig at the **Casa Club Ramones** museum on the outskirts of Mexico City, the latest dirt from our columnists, and more reviews than you can handle.\\
