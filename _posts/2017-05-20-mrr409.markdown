We have an oral history of **Thrillhouse Records**, the infamous SF venue/record store, followed by psychedelic young New Yorkers **KALEIDOSCOPE**, and a perspective on punk after the disaster in Fukushima, Japan from BAND OF **ACCUSE**. We interview Montreal outfit **GAZM**, Sheffield synth punks **NACHTHEXEN**, Cleveland rippers FUCK YOU PAY ME, Irish punk legends **PROTEX**, and the founder of Philly’s **Break Free Fest**. We’ve also got photo spreads from **Damaged City** and **Everything Is Not OK III fests**. All of this plus the columns and zine, book, film, and record reviews you know and love. Order yours today!\\
