	using the button <i>"buy now"</i> you can immediately pay ( via paypall/credit card ) a single object including its shipping costs.<br>
	when we'll display the payment we'll send you a notification and a shipping confirmation. Delivery depends on your location. <br>
	We usually use registered mail.<br>
